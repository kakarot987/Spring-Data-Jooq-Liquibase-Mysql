Example of Implementation of Spring Boot with Liquibase and Jooq:

**Spring Boot**:

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create micro service. It is used to build stand-alone and production-ready Spring applications.

Features:

->Create stand-alone Spring applications

->Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

->Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

->Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

->Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

->Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

**Liquibase**:

Liquibase provides a great starting point for teams addressing the challenges that come with managing database schema changes.

It has the ability to manage revisions of your database schema scripts. It works across various types of databases and supports various file formats for defining the DB structure. Liquibase has the ability to roll changes back and forward from a specific point - saving you from the need to know what was the last change or script you ran on a specific DB instance.

**JOOQ**:

jOOQ is a library that will let you create Java Classes such as POJOs by reading your database and lets you write type-safe SQL queries.
